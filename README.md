# Anna's Diary

Flutter app for personal planning, private diary and the shared **Noi ♡** space.

Current release line: **v0.33.2**.

## Core areas

- Private agenda and planner: Today / Week / Month / Year.
- Private diary: Note, Photo and full vector Sketchbook.
- Noi ♡: shared agenda plus the same Note / Photo / Sketch diary tools.
- I nostri ricordi: shared memories grouped by memories, days, months, years and timeline.
- Offline-first private/shared queues with deterministic cloud reconciliation.
- Structured local state on Sembast with checksums, rollback records and account isolation.
- Media Engine 2.0 with binary assets separated from structured state.
- Supabase Auth, Database, Realtime and private Storage.
- Firebase Cloud Messaging for Android Noi ♡ push notifications.
- Local reminders with notification diagnostics and repair tools.
- Portable JSON backup and account-scoped safety snapshots.

## Quality gates

GitHub Actions runs locked dependency resolution, Flutter analyze, the full test suite and a Web release build on every pull request and every push to `main`.

Release Android builds remain manual and use Flutter 3.47.5 for reproducibility. Release APK signing requires the stable keystore credentials in GitHub Secrets; the workflow deliberately refuses ephemeral or cache-backed signing keys.

See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `supabase/README.md` for implementation details.

## v0.33.2 — Reliability & Cleanup

- Fail-safe startup when persistent local storage cannot be opened.
- No temporary-directory fallback for database or media.
- Transactional account switching.
- Atomic core-state backup restore with crash-safe full-sync recovery.
- Redundant Noi ♡ hub Realtime subscriptions removed.
- Permanent CI quality gate.
- Stable secret-backed Android release signing required.
- Runtime version metadata aligned across backup and push registration.
